## System Architecture

### 1. Overview

The QuantumLink Network Optimization system will be built using a modular architecture, allowing for scalability and ease of maintenance. The system will consist of the following key components:

- **Data Collection Module**
- **Optimization Engine**
- **User Interface**
- **Database**

### 2. Components

#### Data Collection Module

- **Function:** Gather real-time data from network nodes
- **Technologies:** Python, REST APIs
- **Details:** This module will use REST APIs to collect data on network performance, including latency, bandwidth usage, and packet loss. Data will be aggregated and sent to the Optimization Engine for processing.

#### Optimization Engine

- **Function:** Analyze data and optimize network performance
- **Technologies:** C++, Machine Learning Algorithms
- **Details:** The Optimization Engine will utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze network data and suggest optimal configurations. It will provide real-time adjustments to improve efficiency and reduce latency.

#### User Interface

- **Function:** Provide a user-friendly interface for monitoring and control
- **Technologies:** React.js, Node.js
- **Details:** The User Interface will be a web-based application built with React.js, providing real-time dashboards and control options for network administrators. It will communicate with the backend through Node.js.

#### Database

- **Function:** Store historical data and configurations
- **Technologies:** PostgreSQL
- **Details:** The Database will store all collected data, optimization results, and configuration histories. This will allow for historical analysis and trend prediction.
